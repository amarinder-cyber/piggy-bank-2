# Assignment 2: Oracles

## Instructions 

The repository for assignment #2 will be released on Saturday morning (November 26), so you can get started on in over the weekend. The assignment is due on December 2 (Friday) at midnight. That gives you 1 week. 

Assignment #2 repo will have a PiggyBank contract for you to update. It will be a functioning contract that meets the requirements of assignment #1.

Please note: changes or new commits made to your assignment #1 repo after midnight on Friday November 25 will not be accepted.

Also note: your contract for assignment #1 may look different and thatâ€™s ok. Marks will be awarded for functional code and it is expected that implementation may vary.

The steps for assignment #2 are:

1.	Add a function to the PiggyBank contract (will be provided to you in assignment 2 repo) to get the value of the piggybank balance in USD (cents). So 100 = $1USD. Note you will have to use an oracle to complete this assignment. Chainlink has an oracle setup on Goerli that you can use. Assume 1GoerliETH = 1ETH (mainnet). Check out the chainlink tutorial from class on November 24 to find the contract information and the chainlink module to import if you need help with where to start. 
2.	Test your code, deploy your contract on Goerli, and again update your code with a comment near the top indicating your new and improved PiggyBank contract address. If you like, you can put any amount of Goerli in your deployed contract.
3.	Edit this file (README.md) to answer the questions below in your own words. 
4.	Make sure your updated code and README file are located on your main branch so I can mark. 

## Questions

Answer the following questions in 1-2 paragraphs in order to complete the assignment. 

### 1. Why are oracles necessary on the blockchain?



### 2. How does Chainlink ensure oracle data is trustworthy? 



### 3. Why might pseudorandom number generation using keccak256 create a vulnerability for a smart contract? 



### 4. List four cases that would require the use of an oracle.
